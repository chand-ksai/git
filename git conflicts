Here's a clear, step-by-step guide tailored to your workflow:

---

### üß≠ What Causes Merge Conflicts?
- Two branches modify the **same line** in a file.
- One branch **deletes** a file, the other **modifies** it.
- A file is **renamed** in one branch and **edited** in another.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è How to Resolve Merge Conflicts (CLI Workflow)

1. **Trigger the merge**:
   ```bash
   git merge feature-branch
   ```
   Git will pause and show conflict markers in affected files.

2. **Check conflict status**:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   You'll see files marked as "unmerged".

3. **Open the conflicted file**:
   You'll see something like:
   ```text
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   Your changes
   =======
   Incoming changes
   >>>>>>> feature-branch
   ```

4. **Manually edit the file**:
   Decide which changes to keep ‚Äî or combine them ‚Äî and **remove the conflict markers**.

5. **Mark the file as resolved**:
   ```bash
   git add filename
   ```

6. **Complete the merge**:
   ```bash
   git commit
   ```

### üß∞ Pro Tips for Your Stack

- Use `git mergetool` if you prefer a visual interface.
- For Terraform modules or YAML configs, be extra cautious ‚Äî whitespace and indentation matter.
- For binary files (e.g., `.jar`, `.png`), Git can't auto-resolve. You'll need to choose one version:
   ```bash
   git checkout --ours filename
   git checkout --theirs filename
   ```

---

### üîê Bonus: Conflict Prevention

- **Pull often** to stay in sync.
- **Rebase** instead of merge for cleaner history:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   ```
- Use **feature flags** to isolate risky changes.

#####  What are the common mistakes during merges?  #####
Merges in Git can feel deceptively simple ‚Äî until they go sideways. Here are the most common mistakes developers (even seasoned ones) make during merges, especially in fast-moving teams or complex CI/CD pipelines:

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Git Merge Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Happens | How to Avoid It |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Merging without pulling latest changes** | You merge a branch that‚Äôs outdated, causing conflicts or overwriting newer work. | Always run `git pull` before merging. Use `git fetch` + `git rebase` for cleaner history. |
| **Ignoring merge conflicts** | Developers skip conflict resolution or blindly accept one side (`--ours` or `--theirs`). | Manually inspect and resolve conflicts. Use `git status` and `git diff` to guide you. |
| **Committing unresolved conflict markers** | Accidentally committing files with `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` still in them. | Use linters or pre-commit hooks to catch this. Always review diffs before committing. |
| **Merging large feature branches without review** | Big merges introduce bugs or regressions that are hard to trace. | Break into smaller PRs. Use code reviews and CI checks before merging. |
| **Using `git merge` when `git rebase` is better** | Merge creates messy history with unnecessary merge commits. | Use `git rebase` for linear history, especially in feature branches. |
| **Force-pushing after a bad merge** | Trying to fix history but accidentally overwriting good commits. | Use `git reflog` to recover. Communicate with your team before force-pushing. |
| **Not testing after merge** | Merge completes, but the code breaks due to subtle incompatibilities. | Always run tests locally or trigger CI pipelines post-merge. |

### üß† Bonus Tips for DevOps Pros Like You

- **Automate conflict detection**: Use tools like GitKraken or GitHub‚Äôs merge queue to preemptively flag conflicts.
- **Protect main branches**: Enforce branch protection rules to prevent accidental merges or force pushes.
- **Use semantic commits**: Helps trace changes during merges and rollbacks.
