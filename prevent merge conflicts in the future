Great question â€” preventing merge conflicts is all about **proactive collaboration, clean workflows, and smart tooling**. Hereâ€™s a practical guide tailored for someone like you whoâ€™s already deep into DevOps and cloud engineering:

### âœ… Best Practices to Prevent Merge Conflicts

#### 1. **Pull Frequently, Rebase Often**
- Keep your local branch up to date with:
  ```bash
  git fetch origin
  git rebase origin/main
  ```
- Rebasing avoids messy merge commits and keeps history linear.

#### 2. **Work in Small, Focused Branches**
- Break features into atomic changes.
- Smaller PRs reduce the chance of overlapping edits.

#### 3. **Communicate Early**
- Let teammates know what files or modules you're working on.
- Use GitHub issues or Slack threads to coordinate.

#### 4. **Use Code Owners and Protected Branches**
- Enforce reviews on critical files (e.g., Terraform modules, Kubernetes manifests).
- Prevent direct pushes to `main` or `prod`.

#### 5. **Standardize Formatting**
- Use tools like Prettier, ESLint, or `terraform fmt` to avoid whitespace conflicts.
- Automate with pre-commit hooks:
  ```bash
  pre-commit install
  ```

#### 6. **Modularize Your Codebase**
- Split infrastructure into reusable modules (which you already do).
- Isolate changes to reduce surface area for conflicts.

#### 7. **Use Feature Flags or Toggle-Based Deployments**
- Avoid long-lived branches by merging incomplete features behind flags.
- Keeps trunk clean and deployable.

#### 8. **Automate Conflict Detection**
- Use CI tools like GitHub Actions or GitLab pipelines to simulate merges and flag conflicts early.

### ðŸ§  DevOps-Specific Tips

- **Terraform**: Use separate state files per environment to avoid locking issues.
- **Kubernetes**: Avoid editing shared manifests directly; use overlays (e.g., Kustomize or Helm).
- **GitOps**: Sync changes via pull requests only â€” never manual edits in production.
