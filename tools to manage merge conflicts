### ‚öôÔ∏è How to Set Up a Merge Tool in Git

Example: Set up **Meld** as your default tool
```bash
git config --global merge.tool meld
git mergetool
```

You can also configure:
```bash
git config --global mergetool.prompt false
git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3
```

This gives you a clearer 3-way diff: `LOCAL`, `BASE`, and `REMOTE`.

### üß† Pro Tip for DevOps Workflows

For infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, Helm, etc.), consider using:
- **Structured diff tools** like `terraform plan` or `helm diff` before merging.
- **CI pipelines** that simulate merges and flag conflicts early.
